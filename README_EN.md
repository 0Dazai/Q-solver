## What This Is

Q-Solver is an AI desktop problem-solving assistant.

When you see a question, a code error, a formula, a chart, or English content on screen, you do not need to switch tabs and copy-paste everything into a chatbot. Just take a screenshot and send it straight to your model for analysis.

Its core strengths are:

- screenshot-first solving for coding questions, tests, interviews, and debugging
- hidden mode for lower-profile use
- floating output that does not keep stealing focus
- click-through support so it can stay at the edge of your screen
- less noticeable in many screen recording or screen sharing setups
